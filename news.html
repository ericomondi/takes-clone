<br />
As you know, the number of available orders usually goes down around this time, but there’s still enough to make some money if you are interested. It’s also a good time to take a break and relax or just spend some quality time with loved ones and family.<br />
<br />
As always, we will be counting on your help come spring. The new season is not that far away. Thank you for staying with us and for being a part of our WriterBay family.<br />
Moving on to our targets for the past month. Unfortunately, they were not as good as we’d hoped for.<br />
The Product rate is 4.56, which is rather low compared to the previous few months. High quality is one of the reasons our customers choose us, so let’s not let them down.<br />
The Lateness rate - 3.35%. It’s one of the worst results we’ve had in months, and it’s rather disturbing. So, let’s switch gears and get back on track.<br />
We’d also like to remind you that a deadline extension is not a given and is not always available. So, once you confirm the order, be ready to deliver within the initial deadline. Or, if you need more time, make sure to negotiate it before confirmation.<br />
<br />
And now some words of appreciation from our clients:<br />
<br />
***** You&#039;re amazing. Thank you again for helping me gain a better understanding of the assignment. You are truly appreciated. Happy Holidays! Be safe. 271395185<br />

During this last week, we had an increase in the number of available orders, so it&#039;s a good chance to earn some extra money before the holiday season. Let&#039;s make the most of it so we can all happily enjoy some quality time with our family and loved ones during the Christmas holidays.<br />
Moving on to our targets for the past month. We ended November on a high note:<br />
Product rate - 4.7; Nicely done, everyone!<br />
Lateness rate - 1.86%. Good job!<br />
Surely, everyone must be excited to see more available orders in the system, but please don&#039;t overdo it. Manage your workload smartly to avoid lateness.<br />
<br />
Also, please pay attention to clarification requests. We ask that you check the order details before or shortly after confirmation and seek clarification immediately if needed. This way, we have more time to process your request and get the necessary details from the client. Moreover, we have a much higher chance of actually reaching the client this way, as they tend to stay online for some time after placing an order.<br />
<br />
Update for WebMoney users: please note that there are possible delays with funds transfers using this payment method, hence we recommend you to consider switching to other available options. Please reach Help Desk for guidance on the change.<br />
<br />
Finally, moving on to our favorite part - some positive feedback to brighten up your day:<br />
<br />
*****Great work, especially with such short notice. Sorry to have put that on you. Thank you for going above and beyond to have it completed in time. Again, thank you, and Happy Holidays! 354288765<br />
*****Fantastic work! I was given exactly what I needed within the timeframe that I set up, and my writer was not only very capable but also very accommodating when it came to changes. They also had a very discerning eye when it came to details, as they noticed something that I had failed to mention and went out of their way to bring it to my attention. 5/5, would definitely recommend! 253756269<br />
*****Please hire more writers like writer #367954571. This writer is amazing and truly a gem. 367954571<br />

You might have noticed the number of available orders seems to be below average compared to previous seasons. That’s because we have a lot of active writers and most of the orders are taken fast. We are trying to optimize the assign process and ensure that orders are allocated evenly. Yet the system is not perfect, and we apologize for any inconvenience. We still hope to see some increase in the workload soon.<br />
<br />
Moving on to our target results:<br />
Product rate - 4.7. Great job!<br />
Lateness rate - 1.81, not bad at all, but let’s do even better this month.<br />
And a small reminder about clarification requests. It’s okay to seek clarification from the client, but make sure you check all the details and submit your clarification request shortly after confirmation. We have a much higher chance of reaching the client that way.<br />
Last but not least, a few positive feedback from our clients:<br />

Unfortunately, we haven&#039;t seen any significant changes in the number of available orders during September, but we hope that tendency will change this month. Thank you for your patience and loyalty.<br />
<br />
Regarding our targets for the past month, we had some great results:<br />
Lateness rate -1.81%.  We reached the target, so let&#039;s keep it going. Please remember to notify the support team in case you are faced with some unforeseen circumstances that may lead to lateness so the issue can be addressed in a timely manner.<br />
Product rate – 4.72. We did well, too. You rock!<br />
<br />
We also have news on the increase on the variety of orders that may come to the system - from now on, apart from our usual assignments, there will be orders on programming that will require writing a code in specific language. There orders will have &quot;Programming &amp; Related&quot; as a type of work and will differ from the ones we currently have in the system - hence, please make sure to be attentive and check all the details before sending your application.<br />
<br />
And as always, let&#039;s enjoy some well-earned feedback from our clients:<br />

<br />
As for our targets for the past month, we&#039;ve achieved some great results:<br />
Lateness rate - 1.64% - Nicely done; let&#039;s keep it up during the high season.<br />
Product rate - 4.74 - Good job!<br />
<br />
We also have a couple of updates we&#039;d like to share with you:<br />
<br />
1. “Useful materials” section was recently updated. Now you can find more details regarding the extras our clients can order and the use of AI in this section.<br />
2. “Get a promotion” button got upgraded as well. From now on, it not be available permanently and in some cases might be disabled. Accounts, that were recently promoted, downgraded or denied in promotion due to not met requirements will not be able to apply for promotion until 2 months pass (as per our Promotion rules). Therefore, if you see that the &quot;Get a promotion&quot; button is grey, just hover your mouse over it to find out why it&#039;s temporary disabled.<br />
<br />
We did receive a number of violations with promotions applications in the past and, unfortunately, were forced to deny applications that did not follow the 2-months rule. We hope that the button upgrade will allow us focus more on the applicants who meet all the requirements and result in more promotions.<br />
Please make sure to apply for a promotion wisely!<br />
<br />

We are also looking for ways to attract more customers and, thus, increase the workload. As always, we highly appreciate your cooperation and loyalty to our platform. Together, we will definitely overcome any challenges that await us.<br />
<br />
Moving on to our July targets. We have great results for both Lateness and Product rate:<br />
Lateness rate - 2.07%. Nicely done, everyone. Don’t forget to update the support team in a timely manner if you face some unforeseen circumstances or other issues to avoid lateness and unwanted fines.<br />
Product rate - 4.7. Thank you all, and let’s continue to provide our clients with top-notch content.<br />

<br />
*****HEY HEY HEY!!!! I&#039;ve just skimmed through the paper! Omg! Surprizingly beyond expectations, to be honest!!! I was super hesitant, and I almost was about to cancel the order; it&#039;s my first time ever requesting such a task from these websites. But I&#039;m super grateful, and you made it worth the try!!!!!! I&#039;ll go over the paper in detail and get back to you in a few hours.

It’s also a great time to pick up some new skills. So, if you had your eye on some new course, now is the time to take it.<br />
<br />
A few words about our target results:<br />
Product rate - 4.69; nicely done! Keep up the good work.<br />
Lateness rate - 2.09%. Sadly, this is not a good result, especially for a low season. The workload right now is not intense, so please take time to plan your work schedule to manage projects better and avoid lateness. Our clients pay for specific deadlines, so they expect timely delivery. Thank you! <br />
<br />
Also, please pay attention to paper details. Sometimes our clients order &quot;Basic explanations&quot; extra for problem-solving/calculation-based assignments. It is reflected in the &quot;Preferences&quot; section of the order and is included into the order&#039;s payment.  In short, you are required to provide explanations for the calculations and/or describe how the problem was solved.  The more detailed an explanation, the better. Those explanations should be uploaded as a separate file along with your final submission.<br />

We have recently faced a number of instances where the writer’s account was not operated by the rightful owner. We do notice that applicants whom we decided not to hire, search for ways to bypass our decision and work on accounts that belong to someone else.<br />
<br />
We find it unfair that these writers are competing for assignments with those, who passed all the tests themselves and work with us on conditions of trust and honesty. Such competition is unacceptable, especially during the low season.<br />
<br />
Given the above-mentioned, we have updated our Terms of Use (specifically, Clauses 3.2.11 and 8.8) to minimize the number of such instances from happening.<br />

So there’s no better time to take that vacation you’ve been putting off and spend some quality time with your family. The number of orders available in the system will be lower for some time but we’ll do our best to distribute them evenly. We hope for your understanding.<br />
As for our targets for the past month, we got some fairly good results:<br />
<br />
- Lateness rate is 2.56%, not bad, but we definitely can do better.<br />
- Product rate is 4.63; let’s try to improve it during the low season; you’ll have more time to focus on each specific order.<br />
<br />
Also, an important update - we had to forego Hyperwallet as a payment option but our Finance Department is considering alternatives among the available options. We&#039;ll let you know more once we receive updates from them. Please note that the process of launching a new payment processor in the system is time-consuming, it usually takes around 6 months to implement everything.<br />
<br />
Since we are not working with Hyperwallet anymore, the Hyperwallet details will be removed from the system shortly. We also would like to remind you that payment method change requests are expected to be raised by June 12th via Help Desk. For requests received later we do not guarantee that they will be processed before the payout.<br />
<br />
And finally some feedback:<br />

*****Did exactly what I needed and followed the prompts I set for them. Very good paper 10/10. Will be using this writer again in the future if I need to do so! Thank you! 19059<br />
*****I truly thought that all hope was lost when it came down to my last paper. I had read the entire textbook cover to cover, but could not tell you how to write the paper for the life of me. My writer was exquisite and got me a perfect paper under the deadline. Thank you so much. I&#039;ll be back if ever in another pinch. 281485203<br />

From our side, we would like to remind you that draft is provided to show progress on the order: it can be uploaded per client’s/ agent’s / manager’s request or for deadline extension. Checking the completed work for AI percentage is not one of them.

However, we are doing everything possible to bring in more clients and orders. It&#039;s just one more challenge that we have to go through together. So, for now, let&#039;s be patient. Our team is trying to allocate the orders evenly as much as possible. Thank you for your understanding and dedication.<br />
<br />
With that being said, we have some excellent news as well. We reached great results for both Lateness (1.71%) and Product (4.7) rates. Let&#039;s keep this positive streak going. Timely delivery and excellent quality are the main reasons clients choose to stay with us and place new orders.<br />
<br />
We also have to address the matter of AI. As you know, AI software has been gaining popularity lately, and some of our writers used that for the completion of orders. Hence we feel the need to stress that the use of AI is prohibited on our platform. AI-generated paper cannot be considered unique, and the use of AI to facilitate one&#039;s working process on our platform will be viewed as cheating.<br />
<br />
We would like to remind you that as per our Terms of Use, the use of AI is equal to plagiarism:<br />
<br />
4.4.2. The use of any AI-software (ChatGPT or any other content-generating tool) aimed to assist in creating product is considered to be plagiarism and is strictly prohibited.<br />
<br />
Hence, fine for plagiarism (50% of the Order price) is applied in cases where AI use was detected. Approved orders with AI use detected are processed as Dispute cases and therefore can result in salary cancellation along with fine.<br />
 <br />
Violation of Clause 4.4.2. may result in immediate and non-negotiable account termination.<br />
<br />

We deeply apologize for the inconvenience.<br />
<br />
Given the situation, we recommend you not to wait when and whether the issue with Hyperwallet is fixed but switch to alternative options, so we could be sure you will receive payments from us.  We would recommend you to submit your alternative details via Settings &gt; Payment details&gt; Add alternative payment option. Make sure to raise a ticket via Help Desk by March 31st, 3pm GMT to have your payment method changed.<br />
<br />
Note, if you decide to stay with Hyperwallet options, your funds will remain on your balance and will not be withdrawn during the payouts.<br />

As of now, it is technically not possible to submit new details, change the existing ones and send transfers. We are working on solving the problem, however it takes time and Hyperwallet representatives are not very responsive, to our regret.<br />
<br />
Hence, we find ourselves responsible to notify you on the issue as we cannot guarantee we will be able to transfer the funds via payment options covered by Hyperwallet (PayPal, Bank Transfer, Wire Transfer) during the nearest payout period.<br />
<br />
Therefore, if your main payment method is one of the mentioned above and you would like to be paid during the March 16th-20th payment period, please make sure you have active Payoneer account connected to the system or WebMoney - any submitted to your Alternative payment details (Settings &gt; Payment details &gt; Add alternative payment option). Information on these payment options is available by visiting Settings&gt; Payment details&gt; Payment options we provide.<br />
<br />
Please reach out via Help Desk to proceed with the change of your payment method – all the requests received till March 15th 12pm GMT will be processed.<br />
<br />
If you do not consider other payment options and can wait till April 1st-5th payout, we would recommend you to update your payout schedule to keep the funds on hold (Settings &gt; Payment details &gt; Preferred payout schedule).<br />
<br />
To prevent any confusion, please note that the funds will not be withdrawn on March 16th for Hyperwallet services users. The withdrawal will only take place in case we are sure we can transfer the funds.<br />
<br />
As of now, we do not have information when the Hyperwallet services will be back online - please refrain from reaching out to Live chat or Help Desk with questions on the matter of timing as the issue is not from our side and cannot be solved by our Technical Department. <br />
<br />
We apologize for the inconvenience and count on your understanding and patience.<br />

We expect that March will bring not only a change of seasons but an influx of orders to our system. The season is starting to gain momentum, and we hope you&#039;ll be there to help once we get our hands full.<br />
<br />
We are also excited to share our results for the past month:<br />

So, let’s do our best to prepare.<br />
<br />
A few words about our targets for the last month:<br />
- Product rate - 4.70. It’s quite good, but we can do better. Please, be as meticulous as possible with the details; even the small ones matter in the end.<br />
 - Lateness rate – 1.54%. It’s rather an impressive result. Thank you for the hard work, and let’s carry on.<br />
<br />
As for Hyperwallet services, they are unfortunately still not available due to the ongoing update of the Hyperwallet form. The form is on the final testing stage and we expect it to be back this month - we will keep you posted on the matter.<br />
<br />
And, finally, moving on to our favorite part - some positive feedback to brighten up your day:<br />

As usual, we will have fewer orders available in the system for the next month or two. So, please use the respite to spend this loveliest, magical season with your family and loved ones. Let&#039;s all make beautiful memories that will get us through any hardships the upcoming year may bring and build strength to face new challenges.<br />
We are also very proud to announce the results of the last month. We finished the season on a high note, and it was your hard work and dedication that helped us achieve such great results:<br />
<br />
 - Product rate - 4.61<br />
 - Lateness rate - 3.09%<br />
<br />
So let&#039;s aim even higher next time!<br />
Regarding the Hyperwallet, we are working hard to have it back as an available payment option. Please, wait for further updates. Note, this update relates only the possibility of submitting new payment option that is powered by Hyperwallet as well as the possibility of editing the already existing one. Transfers via already submitted details take place as usual.<br />
<br />
And, our favourite part - some amazing feedback from our customers:<br />

This year was quite a challenge, but still, we made the most out of it. We have to take one last step to see this year and this season through. We expect even more work to come our way this last month, but with the workload comes a great opportunity to make some extra money to spend on your loved one during the holiday season. So let’s make it count.<br />
<br />
Moving on to our results for the last month. We did a great job overall:<br />
<br />
 - The Lateness rate was 2.26%, so nicely done there, taking into account the increased workload.<br />
 - The Product rate was also quite good - 4.65. Keep up the good work!<br />
<br />
We are further excited to share some news:<br />
<br />
1) The “Useful Materials” section was recently updated. Now it has even more information and some tips on formatting styles, specifics of working with orders from UK-based clients, etc. Please, take a look once you have a minute.<br />
<br />
2) We would like to remind you that the Telegram bot is the main means of updates on the orders. Therefore, to keep track on the order situation, it is obligatory for our writes to have it installed. Should you have any questions/issues with installing or navigating the bot, please contact the Help Desk.<br />
<br />
Quick note: we did notice that commands are temporary not working properly, so we are working on fixing the malfunctions. As for notifications that you receive via the bot, everything works well.<br />
<br />
3) We managed to send out all the payments via Hyperwallet. Please note that duplicate payments took place in some cases, so if we do not manage to cancel the duplicate transactions, we will recalculate the balance of those writers, whose accounts were influenced by the glitch. We appreciate the patience and understanding of those involved.<br />
<br />
4) Even though we have the possibility of sending funds via Hyperwallet, the matter with this service has not been fully fixed. Hence, payment options powered by Hyperwallet (PayPal, Bank Transfer, Wire Transfer) are now temporary removed from the system until the malfunction is removed.  <br />
We will make sure to send another update once the Hyperwallet services are back on track.<br />
<br />
As always some of the feedback from our customers who love and appreciate your work and dedication as much as we do:<br />
<br />
    Thank you for the hard work that went into this project. I am genuinely impressed. You have relieved an enormous burden on me and allowed me to focus on personal matters. Thanks again. 259064385<br />

More and more orders keep coming in every day, and we have high hopes for this month. If this tendency holds, we&#039;ll soon be pretty busy. Let&#039;s be ready to make the most of it.<br />
<br />
Moving on to our target results for the last month. Unfortunately, Product rate results (4.64) dropped compared to the past few months. So, let&#039;s do our best to get it back on track and keep clients returning.<br />
<br />
Lateness rate results, on the other hand, are quite good – 1.86%. Timely delivery is one of the reasons clients choose our service. So, let&#039;s keep up the good work. Remember, it&#039;s better to take one less order and deliver the rest on time than pack your schedule tight and be late with most of your projects.<br />
<br />
And a small request. If you are planning a vacation or family retreat, or there&#039;s any religious holiday around the corner and you expect a few days off, please make sure to give us a heads-up in advance. If you are working on a big project at that time, please update our Dissertation Manager via message board on order as well. <br />
<br />
As for the Bank Transfer (powered by Hyperwallet), we don&#039;t have updates so far -  the matter is from Hyperwallet side and cannot be fixed by us. Hence, all we can do is wait for the news from them. We will let you know as soon as there is progress.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, it&#039;s time to appreciate a few great reviews left by our clients:<br />

You will see the corresponding button in the orders that have Clarification pending status. By clicking the button, the order will change the status to the previous one - In progress or Revision in progress. This feature is supposed to resolve the problem when everything is in fact already clarified, but the Clarification pending status doesn&#039;t let you upload the final paper.<br />
<br />
As for now, this feature will be available on separate orders and can be used once per order, so we could understand its effectiveness and whether it’s being used properly. Further, it was decided that the access to the button will be provided to writers of Regular status and higher. Mind, the misuse of the button may result in having it revoked, so please use it wisely and remember that you are required to meet the client’s instructions to the dot.<br />
<br />
Since the feature is new, there might be bugs, so we keep a close eye on it.<br />

<br />
We have received several alerts on the matter of the Bank Transfer (powered by Hyperwallet) form submission - the details entered do not get saved on one&#039;s profile. The matter was forwarded to our IT Department and currently they are trying to figure out what might be the problem and whether it can be fixed by us (or it has to be done by Hyperwallet). <br />
<br />
We apologize for temporal inconvenience to those, who were willing to use this payment method in the nearest future and could not submit it. Hence, we would recommend using other available payment options: Payoneer (Credit Card, Global Bank Transfer), Hyperwallet (PayPal, Wire - please mind that these options are not available in every country), WebMoney (we received reports on higher charges, so please keep in mind).<br />
<br />
If Bank Transfer (powered by Hyperwallet) is the only option you would like to use and do not mind waiting, please update your payout schedule to keep the funds on hold until the matter is fixed (go to Settings &gt; Payment details &gt; Preferred payout schedule).<br />
<br />
If you already have Bank Transfer (powered by Hyperwallet) submitted to the system and it is set as your main payment option then the transfers will go as usual because the issue with the form does not influence payouts.<br />
<br />
We appreciate your patience and understanding. We&#039;ll post an update as soon as we have news.<br />
<br />
Always yours,<br />

<br />
We have some great news though. Our results for the last month were excellent.<br />
Lateness rate – 1.68%. We nailed it!<br />
Product rate -4.68. We did great too.<br />
We’d like to thank you all for those exceptional results. Let’s do even better this month.<br />
<br />
As you are aware, our Writer Management and the Support Teams solve different problems - in short, Support are dealing with orders and can be reached in chat or via support@writerbay.com while Managers - with performance and payout matters, and can be reached via Help Desk (preferably) or manager@writerbay.com. To make sure you contact the correct team we updated the information in the floating button on your interface (green button at the bottom of the page, in the right corner).<br />

Having the right people for the job is always important, and we are glad to have each and everyone of you on board. This time we have combined news post for the two months as we did have a low season with minor updates.<br />
<br />
Fall is finally here, as is a new academic year, so we&#039;ll be seeing more and more available orders from now on. Surely, we&#039;ve all enjoyed summer&#039;s leisurely pace, but it&#039;s time to get back to work. Let&#039;s face this new challenge together and make the upcoming season the best one yet.<br />
<br />
Speaking of good results, we did great both in July and August:<br />
Product rate in July reached – 4.67 and last month even better- 4.73 . Keep up the good work! <br />
Lateness rate was also great – 2.13% in July and 1.46%(!) in August. Thank you all for always doing your best and showing impressive results.<br />
<br />
The workload will only get more and more intense from now on for the next few months, but we certainly can get through it. As always, timely delivery and high quality remain our priorities and the reasons our clients choose us. So, let&#039;s do our utmost and keep the bar high.<br />
<br />
Here comes the best part - some amazing feedback from our clients:<br />
*****This is more than what I could have asked for! You did an excellent job. It was my first experience with platform but it surely will not be my last. Thank you so much. 82363<br />

We are still at the low season phase, but even so, we are doing our best to distribute the work evenly for everyone to get some work. Now is a perfect time to take a breather and spend some quality time with your family and loved ones. We are counting on everyone to be back and more fired up than ever for the next high season, so let&#039;s enjoy this respite and make the best of it.<br />
<br />
We are also pleased to inform you that we reached all our targets for the previous month once again: Product rate -4.64 and Lateness rate – 1.92%. Nicely done, everyone. We can aim even higher this time. And while we have fewer orders in the system, for now, let&#039;s make timely delivery our priority and provide our clients with exceptional service they would want to come back for.<br />
<br />
A small but important reminder: it is imperative that you check the order and request any materials needed either before or immediately after confirmation. This way, we have more time to get those from the client, and it helps to decrease the number of late deliveries.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, some amazing feedback from our clients:<br />
<br />

*****The writer did an excellent job, like always. The writer was very proficient in responding to the questions within the prompt. The writer used credible sources, and his answers were comprehensive. Great job! 306349377<br />
*****I loved this writer. The writer was responsive, even though the due date was tight. The work was thorough, and the writer followed directions from the start. I would choose this writer again. 266703289<br />

As usual, there will be fewer available orders in the system for some time, but don&#039;t worry we will do our best to distribute them evenly, so everyone gets a few to work on.<br />
<br />
Moving on to our targets for the last month:<br />
<br />
Product rate -4.55. Nicely done. So, let&#039;s keep it up.<br />
<br />
Lateness rate – 3.18%. We reached this one as well. Thank you all for making timely deliveries even despite the intense workload.<br />
<br />
We are also excited to share a new feature was just implemented into the system: from now on, you can select your preferred payout schedule.<br />
This feature allows you to choose between monthly and biweekly options. You can also put the funds on hold in case you decide to accumulate funds and receive them later in one transfer.<br />
Please note that changes in the schedule cannot be applied during the withdrawal days (every 1st and 16th, GMT) and will take place for the forthcoming payouts, not influencing the active payment period.<br />
You&#039;re welcome to go to Settings &gt; Payment details &gt; scroll down the page to adjust the payment schedule to suit your personal needs and preferences.<br />
For more information, please click on the &quot;Payment Process&quot; button that is both located on the Payment details tab and on Payment Statistics page for your convenience.<br />
<br />
We have also slightly updated some information on our website as well as our Terms of Use (mainly concerning Clause 8). <br />
<br />
Traditionally, we would like to share a few wonderful comments from our clients:<br />

Thank you all for your relentless efforts and hard work so far. Surely, most of us are getting tired already, but we have one last push to make. So, let&#039;s do our best to end this season on a high note. If you are looking to make some extra money, then it&#039;s about time to go out there and make the most of it, there are still plenty of orders for everyone.<br />
<br />
As usual a few words about our results for the previous month.<br />
We reached our Product rate mark – 4.59. Nicely done everyone! It feels really good to see that all your hard work has really paid off. We can surely reach even greater heights this time around.<br />
As for the Lateness rate, we reached it as well – 2.78%. However, there were some fluctuations in the middle of the month, so we were not sure whether we&#039;ll reach it or not till the very end. So, let&#039;s try and improve the results this month.<br />
<br />
Also, please try to be more conscious about managing your schedule. If you are not sure about taking on more orders, then better don&#039;t and deliver the ones you already have in progress first. High quality is still our priority.<br />
<br />
Just a small reminder: please note that you should address revision requests not only from the client but the support team as well. It&#039;s their job to check the paper before delivery, hence they can request corrections to be made to ensure that the finished product meets all the requirements set by the client.<br />
<br />
We are also pleased to share a few positive reviews and words of appreciation from our clients:<br />

Thank you for being a part of our team, for your hard work and dedication! Lately, the number of available orders has increased greatly and we hope it will only continue to grow. It’s time to make good money. So, let’s all roll up our sleeves and get busy.<br />
<br />
Speaking of our March outcomes, we all did a great job:<br />
<br />
Lateness rate results were within the target – 2.46%. Well done! Let’s keep the ball rolling and be the best service our clients could think of.<br />
<br />
Product rate (4.6) was stable for the whole month, and we can all take pride in that. Keep it up! We surely can aim for even better results this month.<br />
<br />
Now to the updates:<br />
1.Some of you may have noticed that from now on, a file up to 100 MB can be uploaded directly to the &quot;Files&quot; section. Hopefully, this will ease the workflow for you.<br />
<br />
2. We are temporary ceasing transfers via WebMoney due to problems with funds withdrawal that our writers face. Hence, if you are using WebMoney as your payment method, please raise a ticket on Help Desk to switch it to your alternative details (make sure you submit those to the system). We urge you to do so as soon as possible to have the new details used for April 16th-20th payout.<br />
<br />
We are also pleased to share a few positive reviews and words of appreciation from our clients:<br />
<br />

We would like to show support to our Ukrainian writers and pray for the safety of them and their close ones. Our team, with all people of the world, is standing for Ukraine.<br />
<br />
The winter is over and spring is finally here. Hopefully with it, the high season will come. We can already see the positive dynamics in the number of orders placed recently. More orders are coming by the day. Not as many as we hoped for, but they are steadily coming in. So, let&#039;s all get ready.<br />
<br />
As usual, let&#039;s take a look at our targets for the last month:<br />
The lateness rate is 2.41% - all good overall, but please remember that timely delivery is one of our top priorities. The deadline extension is not a given and cannot be provided on each and every order. Furthermore, a lot of our clients have rigid deadlines, and there is simply no room for an extension in such cases. So, rather than rely on possible extensions, we would recommend you to complete orders within the original deadline whenever possible.<br />
<br />
The product rate is 4.62- we reached the target, so congratulations, everyone, and thank you for the great work!<br />
<br />
Traditionally, we would like to share a few positive reviews received from our clients:<br />
*****Writer #278694076 is awesome writer who is thorough and does not miss a beat. The writing is very engaging with a welcoming tone. The writer&#039;s knowledge is present in the writing that speaks for itself. I rate the writer with a 5 star, and I highly recommend. Kindly!<br />
*****Very articulate, well thought of, and easy to understand concepts written about. Thank you. 297623942<br />
*****Thank you, writer, I love the insights that you provided, and I am finally feeling more confident that we can get through this. Thank you. 290400708<br />
<br />
Keep it up! May all the orders you complete be rated with 5 stars!<br />
Stay safe!<br />

<br />
Low season is almost over, as you can see, more and more orders come in by the day. So, there will be more work for everyone soon. We do hope for your continued support and dedication. Together we can do great things!<br />
<br />
As usual a few words about our targets for the previous month. Product rate (4.71) - well done, everyone. Let’s do even better this month!<br />
Lateness rate was a bit volatile. Still, we did manage to make it in the end (2.06%). So let’s try to keep it or even improve this month. Surely, timely delivery of orders is one of the main reasons the clients choose us so we’d like to keep it that way.<br />
<br />
We are also glad to announce an update, one that hopefully will make applying for and working on orders even easier. From now on, all the links in the paper details are clickable. All you need to do is just click the link and it will open as a new tab.<br />
<br />
Now our favourite part. A few positive reviews from the last month:<br />
<br />

Now we can all appreciate a bit of quiet and spend some quality time with our family and loved ones before the next high season. Be sure to enjoy this short respite to the fullest! But we hope to see you all set and ready once the orders start coming in.<br />
Also, we would like to share some updates about our results for December. We finished the year on quite a high note.<br />
Product rate - 4.53. We met our target for the Product rate, so once again, thank you for your efforts and dedication.<br />
Lateness rate (4.06%) was a bit high, but with the low season and all, we have a good chance to decrease it, so let’s do our best.<br />

<br />
Since we are moving to biweekly payout schedule, please note the following:<br />
- the next funds withdrawal will take place on January 1st, the money will be sent to your account by January 5th<br />
- check whether your payment details are in the system (Payoneer users have to submit their Payoneer details again); submit the details by December 31st to be included into payout lists<br />
- the minimum amount for withdrawal is $100 (not $50 as it used to be). If you have $50+ but cannot reach $100 and would like to be paid on those dates, please contact us via Help Desk by December 28th and we will make an exception for you.<br />
<br />
Please remember that the payment method change related matters are to be addressed by 27th / 12th of the month, so we could process them before the beginning of the payout.<br />

You’ve been a tremendous help, now more than ever, and we are proud to work alongside you. Yes, this season is unlike the previous ones, but we still have a steady supply of orders and it’s because of your hard work and dedication that we can provide our clients with such an awesome experience and service. It is already December and the Christmas season is almost upon us, so let’s give this last month of the high season our very best. Don’t miss the chance to make some extra money to spend on family and loved ones making this holiday season all the more fun and brighter for them.<br />
<br />
Now for some great news. We reached our targets for both Product (4.61) and Lateness (2.78%) rates last month. You all rock! Let’s not stop there and do even better this month.<br />
<br />
And a little reminder – please, note that providing a draft does not always guarantee an extension. It’s always up to the client whether or not to give us more time. So, it’s best to aim and complete the orders within the initially allocated deadline. Timely delivery is always a priority.<br />
<br />
We also have an important update for the availability of our Writer Managers as we will have a short break in mid-December. Therefore, please note that requests received after December 14, 12 pm GMT will be processed by Writer Managers starting from December 20.  <br />
<br />
We do understand that the dates of our unavailability clash with the payout dates. Hence, to be sure all of you receive your payments before the Christmas and are not influenced by our absence in any way, it was decided to move the payment period a couple of days earlier: this time, all the balances will be withdrawn from the system on December 10. All the written off funds will be sent to you by December 14, end of the day (GMT).<br />
<br />
Reminder, the transfer time depends on your payment method and should be calculated from the last day of the payout period (not from the withdrawal day).<br />
<br />
All the matters related to payment method change or anything related to payouts must be closed by December 8, so to make sure we address all of them before the withdrawal of December 10.<br />
<br />
And we are also pleased to share a few positive reviews and words of appreciation from our clients:<br />
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately the matter is external and we cannot fix it as quickly as we usually do.<br />
<br />
Therefore, we are temporary asking you not only to upload final files to the order but also send a separate message with a link where the file can be downloaded.<br />
<br />
 Please use this service to send the files to us via links: https://wetransfer.com/<br />
<br />
If you submitted an order 3 hours ago from now, please create a link and send it via messages, too, to stay on the safe side. We will make sure to process everything as well as update you once the matter is finally fixed.<br />
<br />
We truly hope for your understanding and cooperation here.<br />

<br />
We have added 3 commands that you can type manually:<br />
<br />
/notconfirmedorders - you will have the list of all orders assigned but not confirmed; every order will be followed by a button “Request order details”. &quot;Request order details&quot; button provides main order details and options to &quot;Confirm&quot; or &quot;Reassign&quot; the order.<br />
<br />
For your convenience, we have added reasons for reassigning the order - you will see those after pressing the button &quot;Reassign&quot;.<br />
<br />
/myorders - provides the list of all confirmed orders each followed by the options to “Request order details”, “DDL extension” or update about uploading the final (“I will send in 30 min”). Hence, your requests will be forwarded to the system for future consideration.<br />
<br />
/telegramchannel - will provide you with a link to our News Feed channel (you need to press ‘news’)<br />
<br />
Still don’t have the bot? Try it, it’s free and very convenient!

<br />
Your dedication and diligence courageously saved the previous high season. For someone, low season is a time to exhale with ease while others may feel discouraged due to the complex orders distribution process. However, we would like to offer you to change your angle and devote the precious time for the further improvement that will allow you to double your profits and climb the corporate ladder in the approaching hot season.<br />
<br />
Areas of improvement that worth your attention:<br />
1.	Let us begin with one of the most important matters in the world of academic writing- Plagiarism. As you know we are carefully checking each and every work before the delivery, however we encourage you to check it from your party before uploading the final work using plagiarism detecting software in purposes of maintaining your Performance Overview. <br />
Useful sources:<br />
http://plagiarism.org/preventing-plagiarism <br />
*Free online programs cannot always ensure 100% accurate audit of the work originality, however they will definitely influence on avoiding plagiarism issues.<br />
<br />
2.	Formatting styles are a traditional ingredient of the word processing stew. For your convenience, brief and transparent formatting styles guide may be found in the section “Useful Materials” of your personal control panel. To double-check and supercharge your knowledge, we would suggest you to pass some online quizzes:<br />

http://www.lib.usm.edu/legacy/tutorials/mlatutorial/tutorialindex.php<br />
http://www.lib.usm.edu/legacy/tutorials/turabian/tutorialindexTur.html<br />
<br />
3.	An essential channel of communication- Telegram. Track the updates on your orders easily and keep up your time- management. Note that we are tracking the activity of telegram users and responsible attitude towards our requests will not go unnoticed. <br />
If you read this post till the very end you are on the right track to the further improvement. Remember, the more you learn, the more you earn.<br />

<br />
We are pleased to inform you that we are expanding the selection of our work types, thereby increasing the opportunities for you to show your creativity! We have implemented 2 new types of work into our system, specifically:<br />
Dissertation Topic<br />
Poster Presentation <br />
<br />
A good dissertation topic is the key to the success of a dissertation. It can be very difficult to create a standing dissertation topic, however not for our writers! Create relevant, interesting, manageable topics and receive decent wages.<br />
<br />
An academic poster is a summary of research, scholarly, or creative project in a visually engaging way. It must be academically sound, highlighting the context of your work (through photographs, maps, etc.), your methods, and results (with graphs, charts, photographs, etc.).  <br />

<br />
We also would like to identify problem spots of the matter, requiring extra attention. <br />
<br />
-Initial instructions not included in paper details, but sent via messages. It is essential to check the guidelines provided by the client via all means of communications to ensure that this assignment is something you are capable of doing and you will deliver the paper adequately covering all the instructions. <br />
<br />
-Controversial instructions. Once you face guidelines that might appear ambiguous, always make sure to clarify and reconcile them with a client or consult with a Support Team Representatives. Transparency of instructions is the key to successful performance, isn&#039;t it?<br />
<br />
-Type of work and formatting style correspondence. To stay on a safe side it is always better to double- check weather type of work, formatting style coincides its requirements. You are always welcome to check valuable tips presented in a section Useful materials. <br />
<br />
We highly appreciate your attention towards the matter. If you have a meaningful initiative to share your own revision avoiding tips and tricks you are welcome to contact us via email. <br />

We would like to bring to your attention that our system will be under  maintenance on Tuesday (November 29) from 4 am to 6 am (UTC).<br />

<br />
Please make sure to adjust your deadlines accordingly in order to be on time with the orders. You need to either ask for an extension if available or deliver papers few hours earlier.<br />
<br />
We apologize for the inconveniences caused and hope for your cooperation regarding the matter.<br />

<br />
We are glad to announce that our system is getting better! We have carefully analyzed your feedback on our surveys and did our best to incorporate the majority of your ideas! <br />
<br />
Order page was improved and all the clutter was removed. You will no longer see sections such as Abstract/Slides/Problems etc., if those were not ordered. <br />
<br />
The font size of paper details section was also increased upon your multiple requests. <br />
<br />
Additionally, Zopim Chat window will no longer get opened automatically and you will only see a notification about the new message at the bottom of the page. So, whenever you are having a chat conversation and browsing from page to page, don’t forget to follow the chat window notifications. <br />
<br />
All future technical updates will be published via our Telegram channel, so hurry up to join: <br />

<br />
Recently we came up with the idea to start using Telegram, as this way it might be easier for you to be informed about all the important updates without the necessity to log in to your Writerbay account. <br />
<br />
This service offers an amazing opportunity for you to receive notifications about extra urgent and, therefore, most expensive orders. First come, first served; thus, you will have more chances to receive the order you are interested in.<br />
<br />
Also, in case of being away from computer, you will never miss any important updates published in the News section. <br />
<br />
Please take a minute of your time and help us evaluate our communication channels and improve them. We are considering to introduce Telegram messenger as supplementary communication option and need your feedback on the matter: <br />

<br />
As you very well know, some assignments require you to be aware of certain personal information of the client for accurate order completion, such as gender, location, age, academic or family background, etc. In most cases, the clients provide the needed information within the order details or our Support team makes sure to clarify it with the clients prior to publishing the orders. <br />
<br />
However, in case you notice that some vital information is missing from the order details, please do not hesitate to ask the clients for the needed details via messages. Our Support team will ensure to assist you and contact the client at the soonest. We rely on your expertise in obtaining all the needed details prior to the assignment completion in order to avoid any possible misunderstanings.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />

<br />
Many of you might have noticed that your rating sometimes changes for the reasons outside of the regular factors for rating increase and decrease. We understand that rating is understood by most to be a performance indicator, which is why its sudden decrease may be disappointing. The reason for this is that the rating indicator had been developed and integrated into the system before the system of the selected orders force-assign by Quality Assurance Department was, which is why certain discrepancies in rating calculation occur. <br />
<br />
Nonetheless, high season does not allow us to prioritize it because we first need to ensure a constant flow of orders and the control panel usability optimization for you. With that being said, we would like to officially address all your concerns regarding rating and state that we have not and will not take rating into account when assessing your performance and doing a regular check-ups on your personal statistics until it is optimized, and ask you to do the same.<br />
<br />
Our Technical Department will resume working on the rating indicator optimization during the low season. <br />
<br />
Thank you for being understanding and cooperative on the matter. <br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

<br />
This month we have observed a considerable decrease in the number of writers whose accounts were set on probation period or terminated. We appreciate the efforts and commitment of each and one of you. Please, check some March statistics:<br />
<br />
8 writers received a promotion. Their accounts were upgraded to PRO/PRO Light or Applied Science PRO status;<br />
20 accounts were upgraded to Regular Plus II; <br />
18 accounts were upgraded to Regular Plus I;<br />
<br />
608 bonuses for positive feedback from the clients were given out to writers.<br />
<br />
This number of bonuses has been the highest over the past half a year of recorded statistics, and we are happy to see that our customers’ satisfaction with the work you do keeps growing. Also, we are still reviewing some accounts eligible for promotion to the newly introduced promotion levels, so more promotions are coming!<br />
<br />
Some bad news includes:<br />
<br />
2 accounts were closed due to instances of plagiarism;<br />
2 accounts were closed due to lateness issues;<br />
3 accounts were set on probation period due to lateness or quality issues;<br />
8 writers received warnings due to minor plagiarism, quality and/or lateness issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your hard work and dedication. We sincerely hope that the next month’s news will be even more uplifting. Have a great day!<br />
<br />

<br />
We would like to thank you for your hard work and dedication and introduce our new Promotion opportunities. <br />
<br />
We are adding the Advanced Plus status to our regular PRO/PRO Light/AppliedScience PRO levels.<br />
It will give you an ability to take 10 orders  without waiting for QAD approval and receive 10% higher price;<br />
<br />
The requirements are as follows: <br />
Not more than 10% lateness rate; <br />
No plagiarized works submitted;<br />
Ability to write 30 pages per month; <br />
Ability to complete 10 Help Needed orders per month; <br />
No problems with formatting, following client’s requirements and quality;<br />
Minimum 3 month of active work on orders; <br />
<br />
The application process for Advanced Plus is the same as for PRO/PRO Light. <br />
<br />
Additionally, we are launching a new loyalty program for the writers who do not qualify for promotion ( e.g inability to meet the workload requirements); however, still perform well: <br />
<br />
Regular Plus I Level: 5 auto-take orders <br />
Regular Plus II Level: 3% higher price + 5 auto-take orders<br />
Regular Plus III Level: 5% higher price+ 5 auto-take orders<br />
Regular Plus IV Level: 7% higher price + 5 auto-take orders<br />
<br />
In order to get promoted to a new level, writer should have more than 150, 300, 500 and 1000 approved orders correspondingly and have good performance indicators: Lateness rate less than 20% and no serious issues with quality.<br />
<br />
During the next two weeks all writers who meet the requirements and the ones who need to improve some indicators in order to be promoted will receive emails. <br />
<br />
The loyalty program bonus and promotion bonuses don&#039;t add up and in case the account was set on Probation  period, after passing it the account will be returned to the basic level. Writer may request a level up in 2 month period. Additionally, loyalty bonus may be cancelled if writer remains inactive for more than 2 month with no prior notice. <br />
<br />
We sincerely hope that these new bonuses will motivate you to work with greater dedication and reach new heights! We value the contribution of each one of you! <br />
<br />

We would like to inform you that we are working on improvement of our Promotion system ( more bonuses and updates are coming later on) and system of Probation periods for writers. <br />
<br />
From now on, the writers on Probation period will have limited access to the Available orders, as the most high-paying and challenging ones will not be shown to them.<br />
<br />
We sincerely hope that this new implementation will motivate our writers on Probation to improve their performance so to pass it as soonest. <br />
<br />
Updates regarding the Promotion system will be provided in the middle of March. <br />
Thank you for your hard work and dedication! <br />

We would like to thank you for your feedback regarding the functioning of your control panel. We have received multiple complaints regarding the inability to copy the paper details, and especially troubles with links.  Unfortunately, we may not change this completely for security purposes; however, from now on you will have an ability to open links directly from paper details/messages!    <br />
  <br />
Please follow such steps:    <br />
1. Highlight the link  <br />
2. Right click the mouse  <br />
3. Press the option «Open link a new tab»  <br />
  <br />
If you have some other questions, suggestions or concerns don&#039;t hesitate to contact us!    <br />

<br />
We have recently encountered multiple instances of purposeful non confirmation of orders, when writers are waiting for the actions of QAD, without Confirming the order, providing feedback or sending the Reassign requests if necessary.   <br />
<br />
We would greatly appreciate if you treat the assigned orders with greatest responsibility, and take all the measures on timely manner.   <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, if the tendency continues, we will be forced to implement the fine for non-confirmation of orders. <br />
<br />
Thank you for your cooperation and hard work!   <br />

If the customer has indicated &quot;0&quot; sources in the paper details, it means that there are no specific requirements on the number of sources to use,<br />
but you still have to include in-text citations for all the borrowed ideas along with a works cited page.<br />
<br />
Also, please do not forget to include page numbers in the reference list entry.<br />

<br />
As you know we have already launched mobile application for your convenience. In such a way, you can be constantly updated on the most important events of your active orders, for instance: <br />
<br />
- When the order is assigned;  <br />
- When the deadline expires;   <br />
- When the order has been sent for revision, etc.   <br />
<br />
Moreover, we would like to inform you that the above mentioned application is now available for both IOS and Android.( Just search for &#039;What happened&#039; app in Google play/App Store) <br />
<br />
We find this mobile application really useful, but it would be better to get the feedback from you, actual users of it.  <br />
<br />
Please take a short survey which will help us to improve all the drawbacks of this feature (if there are any).  <br />

We would like to inform you that whenever you get the order assigned, you must either confirm it or send a reassignment request. <br />
<br />
Ignoring the assigned order will certainly eventually result in reassignment, but each such order will seriously influence your account status, rating and reputation with our company. <br />
<br />
Each assigned order on Confirmation pending status should be processed by you on the first priority basis. <br />
<br />
Thank you for your understanding. <br />

<br />
We are pleased to inform you that from now on the best writer of the month will receive a bonus amounting to 3% of the previous payout.<br />
<br />
How we determine a winner: <br />
<br />
Our Quality Assurance Department chooses the person who showed the best results for the previous 30 days in terms of:<br />
<br />
- Number of successfully completed orders (additional credits go for &#039;Extra urgent&#039; and &#039;Help needed&#039; orders) <br />
- Timely delivery<br />
- Positive feedback from the clients <br />
<br />
The best writer of the month will be announced on the 26th of each month. <br />
<br />
So, here is the ID of this time winner: #251988118<br />
<br />
Don&#039;t miss out on a great opportunity to be the next one!<br />
<br />
Thank you for your hard work and continuous cooperation!<br />

<br />
We have recently implemented several features that should help you to avoid instances of lateness with the orders:<br />
<br />
- Next to My Orders line you will see a counter with two numbers - total number of your active orders and the number of active orders with deadlines below 2 hours (highlighted in orange).<br />
<br />
- All orders in My Orders section are sorted by the deadline - the shorter the deadline they have, the higher it will be. <br />
<br />
- Orders with less than 2 hours will be additionally displayed in My Orders tab to show that you need to complete them ASAP.<br />
<br />
- If you are late with the order for more than one hour, the Available Orders section will not be available until you upload it. <br />
<br />
Hopefully this way it will be easier for you to pay attention to deadlines and keep things well organized.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your hard work and cooperation! <br />
<br />

From now on all the offers and requests to apply for a particular order that matches your area of proficiency will be available in the &#039;Invitations&#039; section.<br />

If you are interested in a certain invitation, just click on the Open Order button to check the instructions.<br />

<br />
We are glad to inform you that your control panel has been upgraded. Based on your feedback, we have reorganized the Available Orders section.<br />
<br />
1. If you click on the Availabe Orders section, you will find two new tabs: <br />
<br />
- Just Published - displays orders that have been recently published, and are impatiently waiting for your applications.<br />
<br />
- Extra Urgent Orders - presents projects within short deadlines (2-4 hours). Good opportunity to earn well for less time spent on writing!<br />
<br />
2. You can change the view mode of available orders the way you wish. Available orders can be shown:<br />
<br />
- 20/50/70 per page;<br />
- all in one page.<br />
<br />
3.If an urgent order has been assigned to you (2-4 hours deadline), you will be automatically forwarded to the order page just as soon as you login.<br />
<br />
As you understand, this way we hope to speed up the process of receiving confirmation and save your time.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your hard work and cooperation! <br />
<br />

<br />
As you know it is highly important to stick to the deadlines given.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the number of lateness instances has increased by 30% for the past 30 days. <br />
<br />
From now on if you are late with the order for more than 1 hour, the penalty will be automatically applied.<br />
<br />
The rule is not applicable for the cases when you are waiting for a clarification from the Support Team or a customer.<br />
<br />
If you need a deadline extension due to any unpredictable circumstances,please make sure to submit your request beforehand.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation!<br />

<br />
Thank you for your hard work and dedication! Each of you is important to us, and we are glad to work with such professionals. <br />
<br />
High season is approaching and we are doing our best to upgrade your control panel in order to make our cooperation more convenient and effective. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the number of instances when the quality of projects we provide is below the satisfactory level has grown by 40% for the past 60 days. <br />
<br />
Therefore, we are forced to implement new policies and update the old ones, so that all writers could understand the importance of delivering high quality papers.<br />
 <br />
Updated Terms and Conditions of Cooperation are available for your review: http://www.writerbay.com/agreements.html <br />
<br />
We hope to reduce plagiarism and lateness rates to zero, and prove that our writers deliver projects of only high quality!<br />
<br />
If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact us.<br />

<br />
As you know any instances of lateness affect company&#039;s reputation and bring  financial consequences two both parties. <br />
<br />
Therefore, if writer&#039;s lateness rate exceeds 50%, he/she will not be able to access the Available Order section until completes pending orders.<br />
<br />
Lateness rate will decrease if writer is on time with at least several orders. <br />
<br />
Therefore, everything depends on you. <br />
<br />
Thank you for cooperation and understanding!<br />

<br />
Upon multiple requests to fix the problem with a &quot;long strip&quot; under the My Orders section, we have re-organized the system for your convenience.<br />
<br />
We would like to inform you that from now on all the messages and files will be stored in the sections: &quot;Files&quot; and &quot;Messages&quot; accordingly. <br />
<br />
As soon as you click on the corresponding section, the system will display all unread items. <br />
<br />
By clicking on the Order number, you will be forwarded to the order where the message/file has been sent to. <br />
<br />
If you need to check previously sent messages/files,please click on the &quot;All&quot; tab.<br />
<br />
We sincerely hope that such an implementation will make your control panel even more user friendly <br />
<br />
If you have any comments, suggestions, please do not hesitate to leave your feedback via the Help Desk.  <br />

I would like to remind you that any information borrowed from the outside sources must be properly cited. Attempts to generate not genuine works cited list will result in severe penalties. <br />
<br />
From now on, all the final versions will be thoroughly checked. If the Quality Assurance Department Representatives find any inconsistency in the references and/or works cited page, you will be asked to provide sources you have used in the order.<br />
<br />
Failure to provide the requested sources within 3 days after the query, will result in the re-evaluation of your status.<br />
<br />
We sincerely hope that you will take it into consideration and we will not have to take such measures.<br />

Thank you for your hard work and dedication. <br />

Those three writers who complete the highest number of &quot;Help Needed&quot; orders within the next 30 days will receive a PRO status (without prior application) along with a cash prize! <br />
<br />
The list of winners will be announced on May, 16. Take the chance to demonstrate your great skills and enjoy all the benefits we offer. <br />

<br />
We appreciate each and every teammate and do our best to encourage you.<br />
As you know, we are obliged to provide customers with original content only. <br />
<br />
Plagiarism is a serious academic offense that cannot be tolerated. <br />
Due to the systematic violation of Plagiarism clause mentioned in the Terms of Use, we were forced to terminate the cooperation with 15 writers within the last month.<br />
<br />
We sincerely hope that there will be no necessity for such measures in the future.<br />
<br />

We would like to remind you that writing projects you deliver must correspond to the required amount of full pages ordered by the customer.<br />
<br />
The minimum word count for 1 page is 275 words; however, this value is not an upper limit. <br />
<br />
For instance, if the client has ordered 3 pages, we have to complete 3 full pages.<br />

<br />
I would like to inform you that it is highly important to follow the paper/assignment instructions precisely. <br />
<br />
Moreover, if you were asked to use some specific sources or articles while working on the order, it means that you must cite them in your work and mention in the Reference list. Because all papers you submit are checked for relevance of sources used and their correspondence to in-text citations.<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind that violation of our Policy might result in fine. <br />
<br />
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation on this matter! <br />

<br />
We would like to point out that it is highly important to pay attention to the academic level required in the paper instructions, as it is one of the most crucial details, which helps the writer to understand client’s expectations. <br />
<br />
In most cases, if an Undergraduate  level is requested, it means that client is a High school or College student. Respectively, Bachelor’s level is selected by University students, and Professional is a choice of students who obtain Master’s and PhD degrees. <br />
<br />
The majority of papers are evaluated based on the following criteria:  <br />
-	Relevance of content;<br />
-	Use of source materials;<br />
-	Organization and structure;<br />
-	Cohesion and coherence;<br />
-	Language accuracy;<br />
<br />
Each paper must be well written and correspond to the highest standards of academic writing, but the higher academic level is, the higher client’s expectations are, and you should make sure the paper meets all the requirements.<br />
Please keep in mind that your price for a particular order depends on the academic level as well.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation on this matter! <br />

<br />
We would like to thank all participants of the survey for their ideas, questions and comments. <br />
<br />
Your rating in our system was increased, all your suggestions were carefully reviewed and we will do our best to make your Control panel even more convenient and user friendly. <br />
<br />
Also, we would like to address some of your major concerns: <br />
1.        In order to remove the already approved orders from the left side bar, you need to open each order and read the new message or download the file if any. The point is that all approved orders where you have pending new notifications should appear in the left side bar, and as soon as you answer the message or just read it (if the notification is automatic), the order will disappear from that section of your Control panel. <br />
2.        In order to find the previously approved orders, you need to open  ‘My orders’ section and switch to the tab ‘Previous’. <br />
3.        If you want to see only urgent orders, you should simply tick the box “Urgent orders”,  then press “Filter” button and system will show you the sample.<br />
<br />
In case you have any other suggestions or comments, you are always welcome to submit them via ‘Help Desk’ section of your Control panel or send them to our email.<br />
<br />
Thank you for cooperation! <br />

I’d like to remind you that if the customer modifies initial instructions in any way, you should let the Writer Support Team know. You also need to write a message to the customer and inform them that research was not part of initial instructions. <br />
<br />
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation on this matter! <br />

As you have noticed, the amount of available writing projects keeps increasing; hence, we would like to ask you to apply for the orders reasonably. <br />
Please keep in mind that you have to provide us with the strong arguments why you should be assigned for the particular writing project, in order to convince the Quality Assurance Department that you are the perfect candidate and they should choose you. <br />
In case you fail to substantiate your request or submit irrelevant information, your application will be declined. <br />

<br />
We would like to inform you about the recent policy update. If you are working on the order that exceeds 20 pages, you have to upload a half of the completed paper before 50% of the deadline has passed. <br />
<br />
If you are late with the delivery of first part of the paper, the fine in amount of 10% of the estimated price for the Order may be applied.<br />
<br />
In case you face any circumstances that require deadline extension, please make sure to contact the Support Team beforehand. <br />

Thank you for understanding! <br />

I would like to bring to your attention that we have added one more feature for your convenience. From now on, all our clients will have to indicate whether their papers must be single-spaced or double-spaced.  The compensation for such cases will be calculated accordingly; therefore, please pay extra attention to the paper details.   <br />
<br />
We will continue working on improvements in order to create comfortable conditions for our cooperation.<br />

                        <strong>Every 1st and 16th of the month</strong> the funds are <strong><u>automatically</u>
                            withdrawn</strong> from your balance.
                        It means that there is no separate button for you to press on before every payment period to
                        have your funds withdrawn from the system.
                        This process is automatic and works if your balance meets the requirement for <strong>minimum
                            amount. </strong>

                        The minimum amount for your <strong>first salary </strong> to be written off is
                        <strong>$50</strong>, for all the forthcoming ones - <strong>$100 </strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>The withdrawal usually takes place in the afternoon (<b>GMT time</b>), the exact time may vary. </p>
                    <p>Remember, if your balance is written off, it does not mean the funds are already on your account – the payment process involves multiple parties and does require time.</p>
                    <p>If your <b>balance is below $100 on the 1st/16th morning</b> the funds will <b>remain</b> on your account for further accumulation. Hence, if you reached $100 on 16th evening or any other day of the payment period, your funds will be transferred to your account during the next payout correspondingly.</p>

                    <p>For Payoneer Prepaid MasterCard it can be from <b>a couple of hours to 2 business days</b> depending on the loading speed you select. For some countries there is only one option set automatically.</p>

                    <div class="title">Payout schedule change</div>
                    <p>You have the possibility to select the payout schedule that would be most convenient for you.</p>
                    <p><strong>We provide four options for you to choose from:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>At the beginning of the month</strong> (every 1st day of the month the funds will be
                            withdrawn and sent to you by 5th, end of the day).
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>In the middle of the month</strong> (the withdrawal will take place on the 16th each
                            month and the funds will be sent by 20th, end of the day).
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Twice per month</strong> – both in the 1st-5th time frame and 16th-20th.</li>
                        <li><strong>Keep the funds on your balance</strong> and accumulate some planned amount, in order
                            to have the funds transferred altogether (and paying transfer fees only once).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Note, if you are switching your payment period after the funds were written off on a withdrawal
                        day (1st, 16th),<strong> the changes will be applied to the next payout period (not to the
                            current one).</strong></p>
                    <p>Same rule applies if you change your mind and select a different schedule while the payout period
                        is still in progress – we will use your previous schedule for that payment period and switch to
                        a new one afterwards.</p>
                    <p>Hence, make sure to apply the changes before the beginning of the payout period.</p>
                    <p>If you need the attention of our Writer Managers on the matter, please raise a ticket via Help
                        Desk by <strong>12th / 27th</strong> (depending on the nearest payout date) keeping in mind that
                        the matter will be addressed during <strong>business days.</strong></p>
